# TomZackSVN
Light SVN Client
TomZackSVN was created because there are currently no modern, free SVN clients that properly support the svn+ssh protocol. Most existing tools are outdated, limited, or require paid licenses. This project fills that gap by providing a simple and accessible solution for everyone.

The application relies on the TortoiseSVN command‑line interface (CLI), so TortoiseSVN must be installed on the system. Additionally, OpenSSH needs to be added to the system’s environment variables, and users must generate SSH keys for authentication in order for the client to work correctly.

You only need to download the project, open it in Unity, and build the Windows executable to start using the client.
